			<h1> How to get your first Bullshit tokens (BSH) </h1>
			<p> All you need to do is create a ERC20 compatible wallet, get someone to send you some ether to that wallet and then grab all the BSH you need through EtherDelta!</p>
			<h1> Here's how: </h1>
			<p>(1). Create a wallet on <a href=https://www.myetherwallet.com/">https://www.myetherwallet.com/</a> and send some ether to it. Add the BSH token by clicking "add custom token" on the right column of the screen using the following information:</p>
			<p>Address: 0x91bc206f0a1ffbc399b4a20a41324ed1dad2b718 </p>
			<p>Token symbol: BSH </p>
			<p>Decimals: 0</p>
			<p>(2). Go to : <a href="https://etherdelta.github.io/#0x91bc206f0a1ffbc399b4a20a41324ed1dad2b718-ETH">https://etherdelta.github.io/#0x91bc206f0a1ffbc399b4a20a41324ed1dad2b718-ETH</a>. This is a ERC20 token exchange platform where BSH is listed. Import your wallet by clicking on the top right of the EtherDelta webpage </p>

			<p>Congratulations, you officially have your first BSH tokens. Check your balance on MyEtherWallet and you should see your BSH tokens.</p>
			<p>Note: the tutorial images show a wallet who already contained 1000 BSH and 0.06 ETH in EtherDelta.</p>
