			<h1> How to get your first Bullshit tokens (BSH) </h1>
			<p>To start building your pile of crypto-bullshit, grab your crap from Etherdelta. Basically, you create a wallet, go to their site, get someone to send you some ether to that wallet and then grab all the BSH you need!</p>
			<h1> Follow these simple steps: </h1>
			<p>(1). Create a wallet on https://www.myetherwallet.com/ and send some ether to it. Add the BSH token by clicking "add custom token" on the right column of the screen using the following information:</p>
			<p>Address: 0x91bc206f0a1ffbc399b4a20a41324ed1dad2b718 </p>
			<p>Token symbol: BSH </p>
			<p>Decimals: 0</p>
			<p>(2). Go to : https://etherdelta.github.io/#0x91bc206f0a1ffbc399b4a20a41324ed1dad2b718-ETH 
			This is a ECR20 token exchange platform where BSH is listed. Import your wallet by clicking on the top right of the Etherdelta webpage </p>
			<p>(3). Deposit some ether from your wallet to Etherdelta. Enter the amount you wish to deposit and hit "deposit". Remember to keep some ether in your wallet for transaction fees. </p>
			<p>(4). Buy your first BSH tokens by selecting a row in the order book. Choose the best price. Enter the amount of BSH you wish to buy/ ETH you're willing to spend. Hit "buy".</p>
			<p>(5). The block confirmation should appear in the "My Transactions" section shortly. Now all that's left to do is send your BSH tokens back to your wallet by entering an amount in the "Withdraw" section.</p>
			<p>Congratulations, you officially have your first BSH tokens. Check your balance on MyEtherWallet and you should see your BSH tokens. </p>
